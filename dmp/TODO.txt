[] The gains of the cartesian controller in pr2_dynamic_movement_primitive_controller need to be tuned.

[] The cartesian controller in pr2_dynamic_movement_primitive_controller may need a better way to deal with singularities, e.g. ramping down the desired velocity when the singular values go below a threshold.

[] Fixing the dual_arm_ik_controller such that it (1) receives a dmp for both (2) partitions the dmp and (3) runs them synchronized for both arm using the dmp_ik_controller of the left and right arm. Make sure the status message is publish on the dual_arm_ik_topic.
